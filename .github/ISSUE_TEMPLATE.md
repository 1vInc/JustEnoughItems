Thank you for reporting!

Please do not suggest features from NEI that are not about recipes, JEI is a recipe viewer. [NotEnoughWidgets](https://github.com/TheCBProject/NotEnoughWidgets) will have those features.

If there is an issue:
 * It may already be fixed, please try the [latest version](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/just-enough-items-jei/files).
 * If JEI crashed, please paste the crash log to [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and link it in this issue.
